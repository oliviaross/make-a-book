Generative Book

Our mission is to create a program that generates a book. This book will consist of computer generated poetry. We also intend for the layout of the book to be computer-generated. We have determined two development milestones to organize our project workflow:
Have our program spit out a plain PDF of generative poetry by 2/18
Figure out how to use RiTA.js by 2/8
Generate a few different examples of simple poetry by 2/11
Make sure we are able to export these poems to PDF 
Program will generate poems and export to a JSON file, which will then be used in tandem with Basil.js to create a simple book in InDesign 
Investigate different corpora to pull from (Project Gutenberg, Encyclopedia entries, Exonian articles, etc)
Have our program spit out a algorithmically designed PDF of generative poetry by 2/25 (See examples here, here and here)

Weâ€™re using two different JavaScript libraries, RiTA.js and Basil.js. RiTA.js is a popular framework for programmers interested in creating new works of computational literature, and Basil.js is a library that allows users to create generative InDesign documents. RiTA.js will help us with meta-tasks like identifying parts of speech, ensuring correct grammar, and Markov-based text generation. We will use Basil for generating the layout of the book. 

Our central concern is the content of the book: we will direct the generation of poetry and literary art through the analysis of corpora and the study of different poetic forms (haiku, quatrains, etc.) -- features that are not native to our dependencies. 

We intend to create poems that are both beautiful and technically challenging, but due to the nature of generative poetry, we will be unable to share in more specific terms what those creative decisions will be. However, it is our desire to hold this project to a high standard of rigor--we will not be leaning on the RiTA framework, and intend to make extensive use of Basel.js to create unconventional layout patterns (an exercise sure to be challenging).
